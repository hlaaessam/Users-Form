#### Fields:
- **Full Name**
- **Email Address**
- **Password**

#### Features:
- Validation for required fields (e.g., valid email format, password strength).
- Password confirmation check (ensures the password matches the confirm password).
- A "Sign Up" button to submit the form.
- Link to the Sign In page (e.g., "Already have an account? Sign In").

### 2. Sign In Page
This page allows registered users to log in to their accounts.

#### Fields:
- **Email Address**
- **Password**

#### Features:
- Validation for required fields.
